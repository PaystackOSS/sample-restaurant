# Sample Restaurant
This app simulates an in-person experience in a restaurant where a customer comes in, selects their meals, and completes payment without the intervention of the restaurant's staff.

## Prerequisite

    You need a Paystack Terminal to complete the payment flow of this app. Kindly make a request via support@paystack.com

2. **Gatsby cloud**

    Gatsby functions was used for all API calls to Paystack. You'll need a [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) account if you want to deploy your copy of this site
